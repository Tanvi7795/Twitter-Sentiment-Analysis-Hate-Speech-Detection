## Detection of hate speech using Twitter dataset by leveraging term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) values to multiple machine learning models.

According to Wikipedia, hate speech is defined as “any speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, national origin, gender, disability sexual orientation, or gender identity.” As hate speech continues to be a societal problem, the need for automatic hate speech detection systems becomes more apparent. This repository proposes a solution to the detection of hate speech on Twitter through machine learning using TF IDF values.
